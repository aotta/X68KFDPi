# X68KFDPi
Sharp X68000 Floppy disk adapter based on Raspberry Pico(C)

Use 2 buttons to give X68k the insert/eject signals: you have to eject the virtual floppy (turn off green led) when led flashes, select the image on HxC/Gotek, then re-insert the virtual floppy (Green led re-turned on).
This for disk 1 or 2, as needed.
